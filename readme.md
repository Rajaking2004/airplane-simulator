# AI-Powered Flight Operations & Scheduling System

This project is an end-to-end system for simulating, analyzing, predicting, and optimizing airport flight operations. It leverages a suite of advanced tools, including machine learning, graph network analysis, and constraint programming, to provide actionable insights through an interactive web dashboard.

The system is composed of two main components:
1.  A **Data Processing & Modeling Pipeline** (run in Google Colab) that generates synthetic data, trains predictive models, and runs complex optimizations.
2.  An **Interactive Dashboard** (run locally with Streamlit) that visualizes the outputs and allows for real-time interaction and what-if analysis.

## ✨ Key Features

* ✈️ **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a realistic dataset of flight schedules, including correlated delays and operational parameters.
* 🎭 **Scenario Simulation**: Models overall airport performance under various conditions like bad weather or peak congestion to stress-test the system.
* 🤖 **ML-Powered Delay Prediction**: Uses `RandomForest` and `LightGBM` models to accurately forecast flight arrival delays based on multiple features.
* 🕸️ **Cascading Impact Analysis**: Employs a **Graph Network Model** (`NetworkX`) with the PageRank algorithm to identify critical flights that are potential "super-spreaders" of delays across the network.
* 🧠 **Optimal Scheduling**: Leverages **Google's CP-SAT Solver** (`OR-Tools`) to find a mathematically optimal flight schedule that de-congests peak hours while minimizing deviation from the original plan.
* 💬 **Semantic AI Assistant**: An NLP-powered assistant using `Sentence-Transformers` to understand and answer operational questions in natural language.
* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: A multi-page `Streamlit` application for visualizing all analyses, running simulations, and interacting with the delay predictor.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a two-stage pipeline:

1.  **Offline Processing (Google Colab)**: The first script (`Untitled0.ipynb`) acts as the core engine. It performs all the computationally intensive tasks:
    * Generates the synthetic flight data.
    * Trains the delay prediction models.
    * Builds the flight network and calculates impact scores.
    * Runs the CP-SAT solver to create an optimized schedule.
    * Finally, it exports the results into several files (`.csv`, `.json`).

2.  **Online Visualization (Streamlit)**: The second script (the dashboard file) is the user-facing application.
    * It loads the pre-processed data files generated by the Colab notebook.
    * It provides a user-friendly interface with multiple pages to explore the data, test scenarios, and get AI-driven insights without needing to re-run the complex models.

This decoupled architecture ensures that the user experience on the dashboard is fast and responsive, as all the heavy lifting is done beforehand.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these two parts to get the full system running.

### Part 1: Run the Modeling Pipeline (Google Colab)

1.  **Open the Notebook**: Open the first script file (`Untitled0.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
2.  **Run All Cells**: From the menu, select `Runtime` > `Run all`. The script will automatically install all required dependencies and execute the entire pipeline.
    * *Note: The first cell `files.upload()` is not used by the main script and can be ignored or commented out.*
3.  **Download Artifacts**: After the execution completes successfully (it may take a few minutes), the following files will be generated in the Colab environment. Download all of them to your local machine:
    * `flight_data_with_impact.csv`
    * `optimized_schedule.csv`
    * `model_info.json`
    * `summary_stats.json`

### Part 2: Run the Interactive Dashboard (Locally)

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
2.  **Create a Project Directory**: On your local machine, create a new folder for the project.
3.  **Add Files**: Place the second Python script (the Streamlit dashboard file) and all the files you downloaded from Colab into this new directory.
4.  **Install Dependencies**: Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    numpy
    sentence-transformers
    ```
    Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the App**: In the same terminal, run the following command (replace `your_dashboard_script.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit file):
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_dashboard_script.py
    ```
    The application should automatically open in your web browser.

## 📖 Usage Guide

Once the Streamlit dashboard is running, you can navigate through its different functions using the sidebar:

* **🏠 Executive Overview**: Get a high-level summary of the airport's key performance indicators (KPIs), including total flights, average delay, and on-time performance.
* **💥 Cascading Impact**: View the flights identified by the graph network as the most critical "super-spreaders" of delays. Prioritizing these flights can significantly improve network stability.
* **🧠 Schedule Optimizer**: Compare the original flight schedule with the optimized version from the CP-SAT solver. A chart visualizes how the optimizer de-congests peak hours.
* **🔮 Delay Predictor**: Interactively set parameters for a hypothetical flight (airline, hour, known departure delay) to get an AI-driven prediction of its arrival delay.
* **🎭 Scenario Simulator**: Use sliders to simulate adverse conditions (like bad weather) and see the immediate impact on airport-wide delay metrics.
* **🤖 AI Assistant**: Ask questions about operations in plain English, such as "What are the busiest hours?" or "Which airline performs best?".
* **⚙️ System Diagnostics**: Check the status of the loaded data and the operational mode of the system components.
